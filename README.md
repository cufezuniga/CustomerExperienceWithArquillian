# CustomerExperienceWithArquillian
This is an example of how to use Arqullian to modernize an old monlith jee application so it can be modernized and able to run on Jboss EAP 7.3.
Arquillian is used to test the API call stacks as they are being incrementally refactored to verify the EJBs, JPA entities, and CDI are all working 
by running junit based integration tests.
